00:00 | I'm going to give you some closing comments.
00:15 | I started this semester off in the first lecture,
00:20 | and I asked you all a question.
00:22 | And the question was, why are you here?
00:24 | And I said really, really, really, why are you here.
00:29 | Why did you come to MIT?
00:30 | And I asked you, did you come here
00:34 | so you can just phone it in, get a stamp in four years,
00:38 | and go out?
00:39 | Did you come here so you can walk around
00:42 | some place in privilege and look down on other people?
00:45 | That is not why you're here.
00:47 | That is not why you came to MIT.
00:50 | You came to MIT because you know that this
00:54 | is where we will make the transition from being
00:58 | able to answer any question to knowing which question to ask.
01:01 | That's the transition from student to scholar.
01:04 | And you know that you came here because you have a passion,
01:09 | and you want to come to a place where you can take that passion
01:12 | and you can try to solve really hard problems together
01:15 | to make the world a better place.
01:17 | Those are reasons why you came here.
01:18 | You came here because you know that progress does not
01:23 | happen because of success.
01:26 | It doesn't.
01:27 | It happens entirely because of what
01:28 | you choose to do with failure.
01:31 | That's MIT, that's the MIT way, and that's why you're here,
01:36 | and I asked you to think about that on the first lecture.
01:40 | And then I gave you a whole lot of examples
01:43 | throughout the class.
01:44 | I tried to connect our learning and solid state
01:46 | chemistry to global challenges, to global challenges
01:50 | that we face.
01:52 | And I tried to do that.
01:54 | So I had 36 opportunities.
01:56 | There's many more, so I had to pick and choose
01:58 | carefully to try to give you a sense of some of these things.
02:04 | And the thing is about these challenges, one I just
02:07 | talked about in many others, it's not that these are things
02:12 | that we need to do soon.
02:16 | There is an urgency of now about these things.
02:20 | There is an urgency of now.
02:22 | There's no more time to talk about it.
02:27 | And so these challenges, it's not like something happens over
02:31 | here, happens over there.
02:35 | These are planetary challenges.
02:37 | These cover the whole thing.
02:38 | So it's all on the table.
02:43 | It's all on the line.
02:46 | And by the way, if it's a planetary challenge,
02:48 | it means the challenge doesn't care
02:50 | if you're in a blue State or a red State
02:53 | or if you live in Europe or Africa or here.
02:56 | It doesn't care.
02:58 | So we better figure out how to get our act together and work
03:01 | together to solve these very hard problems.
03:04 | And that's why you're here.
03:06 | That's why you're here.
03:09 | And so on the first lecture, I asked
03:11 | you to think about why you're here,
03:12 | and on this very last lecture, I'm
03:14 | asking you to think about what you want to do about that.
03:18 | What do you want to do about that?
03:21 | And there's a lot of things you can do.
03:25 | I don't mean that you have to work on one of these things
03:29 | we've talked about in this class.
03:30 | That's not what I mean.
03:31 | I mean, think about what it is that you really want to do
03:34 | and how you want to do it, and then go for it.
03:39 | You might have figured that out before you came here.
03:42 | You may know-- gesundheit--
03:45 | already way before you got here.
03:46 | You may be figuring it out right now.
03:49 | You may have no clue what you want to do when you graduate.
03:54 | All of those are fine.
03:59 | But what I want to leave you with
04:01 | is a framework and some thinking that what can I
04:05 | leave you with as a suggestion, as a framework.
04:08 | And it really comes down to three ingredients,
04:11 | three ingredients that I'm asking
04:12 | you to think about when you go off
04:14 | and do, when you leave here, when you go off and do.
04:18 | What are you going to do?
04:19 | How are you going to frame this?
04:20 | And so the first ingredient is kindness.
04:24 | Now OK.
04:26 | Bear with me.
04:27 | Because you're all thinking, what is he talking about?
04:30 | This is a chemistry class, and you're talking about kindness.
04:37 | But you see, the thing is, I'm trying
04:40 | to think about what is a framework that if you follow it
04:44 | you will do good.
04:46 | You will help change this world for the better, which
04:49 | is what we do at MIT.
04:51 | It's how we think.
04:52 | And the thing is I don't care if you define kindness
04:55 | as love or as helping someone or as community or as
05:02 | on one of those dates when the candle was in the room
05:04 | and you did the calculation and you saved the day
05:07 | because you knew oxygen was going to run out.
05:09 | That's all kindness.
05:10 | All of that is kindness.
05:11 | But the thing is that if you have kindness in what you do,
05:15 | it's really hard to do bad.
05:20 | Is that under the hood?
05:22 | Is there an element of kindness?
05:23 | You can't have too much of it.
05:25 | We need that vector.
05:27 | We need that vector in this world.
05:31 | So that's one ingredient, and the second ingredient
05:33 | is knowledge.
05:33 | Now, what I mean by this is acquisition of knowledge.
05:36 | And we have done a lot of that here in this class,
05:38 | and you do a lot of that at MIT, and we
05:40 | celebrate these acquisitions.
05:43 | What I'm asking you to do is think about this
05:45 | as you go forward.
05:47 | How are you acquiring knowledge?
05:49 | How are you learning?
05:51 | That sounds cliche.
05:51 | Always learn.
05:53 | You guys have to keep doing that.
05:55 | You have to keep doing that because, for you, it's
05:57 | nourishment, and it's another one of these vectors.
06:01 | You can't do any harm by learning.
06:04 | You can only do good for yourself and for everyone
06:08 | that you care about.
06:09 | So keep doing it.
06:12 | The rate might change of learning acquisition
06:14 | as a reaction, the rate constant might be lower.
06:18 | We know places where that's already the case.
06:21 | And that's OK.
06:26 | Maybe the order is lower too down there,
06:30 | but I think they probably are learning something.
06:36 | Keep that going.
06:38 | And the last thing is passion.
06:39 | And this involves your talents.
06:43 | You all have talents already.
06:46 | You all have them because that's part of who you are
06:49 | and why you're here.
06:51 | Those are things that you bring a passion to.
06:55 | What are those talents?
06:57 | Maybe some of them are hidden, but work on them
07:00 | and pursue them.
07:01 | Do things that you literally are so
07:03 | excited about you can't sleep sometimes
07:05 | because of the excitement.
07:07 | That's what I'm talking about.
07:09 | Follow that.
07:10 | Feed it.
07:13 | And while you do, lose the fear.
07:19 | Avoid greed, and embrace challenge.
07:22 | That's what MT is.
07:25 | That's why we're here.
07:29 | So I feel like these three ingredients,
07:31 | I've thought about this, and I thought about these three
07:33 | ingredients, and I've thought about--
07:35 | we have these already.
07:37 | You all have these ingredients because that is also MIT,
07:42 | and you are here, and you are MIT.
07:45 | And so what I'm asking you to do is to hold onto them
07:49 | and keep thinking about them.
07:53 | There's a lot of reasons why I love to teach,
07:57 | but one of the big ones is when I think about the challenges
08:01 | that I share with you guys and I have
08:04 | 36 chances to look up in the room
08:06 | and I think about those challenges
08:08 | and I think about these ingredients
08:09 | and I think about all of you, I actually
08:12 | feel like we have a shot.
08:14 | I actually feel that.
