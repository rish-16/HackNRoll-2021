I'm going to give you some closing comments. And the question was, why are you here?And I said really, really, really, why are you here. That's the transition from student to scholar. You came here because you know that progress does nothappen because of success. That's MIT, that's the MIT way, and that's why you're here,and I asked you to think about that on the first lecture. And then I gave you a whole lot of examplesthroughout the class. There is an urgency of now about these things. And so these challenges, it's not like something happens overhere, happens over there. And by the way, if it's a planetary challenge,it means the challenge doesn't careif you're in a blue State or a red Stateor if you live in Europe or Africa or here. So we better figure out how to get our act together and worktogether to solve these very hard problems. And so on the first lecture, I askedyou to think about why you're here,and on this very last lecture, I'masking you to think about what you want to do about that. I mean, think about what it is that you really want to doand how you want to do it, and then go for it. You might have figured that out before you came here. You may know-- gesundheit--already way before you got here. You may have no clue what you want to do when you graduate. Now, what I mean by this is acquisition of knowledge. What I'm asking you to do is think about thisas you go forward. You can only do good for yourself and for everyonethat you care about. We know places where that's already the case. What are those talents?Maybe some of them are hidden, but work on themand pursue them.
