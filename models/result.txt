I'm going to give you some closing comments. And the question was, why are you here?
And I said really, really, really, why are you here. That is not why you came to MIT.
You came to MIT because you know that thisis where we will make the transition from 
beingable to answer any question to knowing which question to ask. 
That's the transition from student to scholar. 
You came here because you know that progress does nothappen because of success. 
It happens entirely because of whatyou choose to do with failure. 
That's MIT, that's the MIT way, and that's why you're here,
and I asked you to think about that on the first lecture. 
There is an urgency of now about these things. 
And so these challenges, it's not like something happens overhere, happens over there. 
So we better figure out how to get our act together and worktogether to solve these very hard problems. 
You might have figured that out before you came here. You may know-- gesundheit--already way before you got here. 
You may have no clue what you want to do when you graduate. 
But you see, the thing is, I'm tryingto think about what is a framework that if you follow ityou will do good.
You will help change this world for the better, whichis what we do at MIT. It's how we think. 
What I'm asking you to do is think about thisas you go forward. 
You can only do good for yourself and for everyonethat you care about. 
The rate might change of learning acquisitionas a reaction, the rate constant might be lower. 
We know places where that's already the case. Do things that you literally are soexcited 
about you can't sleep sometimesbecause of the excitement. 
So I feel like these three ingredients,I've thought about this, and I thought about these three ingredients, 
and I've thought about--we have these already.
